          <p>Monday 16th of May 1983 That Monday started like any other Monday before it. The alarm clock rang at about 5:30. I had a quick shower and breakfast. An early morning look out the window warmed my soul a bit. A few small trees that were edging a tediously grey street and the parking lot across the street seemed to wake and spring to life. It was the middle of May and fresh green leaves invited a flock of the town's sparrows. Chirping over each other, the two biggest males could not come to an agreement over which one was the most beautiful and deserved the attention of all sparrow princesses. I was standing at the window, holding the cup with both hands and drinking a slowly cooling tea.</p>
          <p>A few weeks ago, I had sent out an application and other papers to ICI Company in England. As I had heard from Mr. Jicha, the manager of ICI division in Brno, ICI management was considering opening another division in Bratislava, which could cover business interests in Slovakia. My interest in being employed at ICI Company was welcomed with much enthusiasm, the decision moving slowly but certainly to my advantage. A lot of weight was given to the fact that I had a Masters degree in chemical technology as well as a great deal of knowledge of the English language. According to what I had heard during a phone call with Mr. Jicha last week, the business manager from England had planned his trip to Czechoslovakia for the second week of June. My interview with him was scheduled for that week. I had heard that I had a ninety-percent chance of obtaining a position with ICI; a successful interview with the business manager had been considered to be critical. Initially, I would have just been alone at the Bratislava division to cover all of Slovakia, which could have meant a lot of traveling. If I could prove successful in increasing sales, then I would be promoted and be in a position of hiring more employees and would become the head of Bratislava's division. I was looking forward to that challenge, knowing that it would not happen easily. I was determined to keep learning English; regular trips to England could be very helpful in that endeavor. I understood there was a lot of studying needed in order to learn and remember all the details about ICI products that would make me a real technical sales expert. Everything looked so promising, it was hard to believe. Like a dream … A glimpse at my watch brought me back to reality. Already it was half-past six and it was time to hit the road and go to work. I quickly finished my tea.</p>
          <p>"It is good that we have a car," I thought, because I would not make it on time by traveling in overcrowded buses from Petrzalka. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the car was still where I had parked it last night, in the lot across the street.</p>
          <p>I ran down the stairs, crossed the road, rushed to the parking lot, quickly jumped in, and started the car. I did not expect any troubles because the car was only two months old. It was a red Skoda L-105, a very modest car which did not attract thieves. They preferred luxury models, or at least those with a larger engine. A one-liter, four-cylinder engine with four gears was not an exciting option for thieves who would be trying to outrun a pursuing Member of Public Safety- what they called police officers those days. The majority of car thieves were young people, often teenagers. Teenagers would be absolutely much more attracted to showing off in front of peers in a car not so modest. This logic, that brought us to selecting such a car, also gave me a warm satisfaction. Not that a bigger engine or otherwise more luxurious car would not feel more pleasing inside. Under the given conditions it has been an ideal choice. I shook my head subconsciously: "No, we can not afford a different vehicle."</p>
          <p>Slowly exiting from the parking lot, as I had to pause to let a bus go by, which was crowded by the less fortunate ones that had to travel to work by bus, I caught sight of Comrade Stromcek, the chairperson of my company's Communist committee. A malicious smile ran across my face, but immediately afterwards I felt a freezing chill down my spine and the hair on my neck stand up. Comrade Stromcek had noticed me and shot me with a radioactive look. I have already lost the battle; I was being "pampered" to work in a car and he, the big comrade, must crush himself in a bus. I tried to find an excuse for myself or at least a convenient explanation for when I would be called to a Communist committee in the future. I was trying to make myself believe that, after all, he also has a car, but apparently was saving money for gas, or maybe … possibly this way he became "one of the many," an intimate closeness of man to man that was requested by the doctrine of Communist ethics. That was a logic that nevertheless I never understood. Fully absorbed by questions for which I could not find answers, I did not notice that there was only one left turn and I would be at my destination.</p>
          <p>"If only parking was planned for the people with cars and not for filling a column in a table at a regional committee of the Communist party!" I thought. I ran up and down a couple of adjacent streets and by a bit of luck I found a parking spot. I glimpsed at my watch one more time and I found I only had eight minutes to punch in. I ran towards the company entrance and punched my time card at 6:55. Consequently, I made it on time… I was not yet sitting down in my office when the telephone rang: "Good morning, this is Jan Bielek"</p>
          <p>"Good morning, just a friendly reminder, meeting begins at 7:30 in the vice-president's office," said my boss's secretary.</p>
          <p>I was glad I had a few minutes to prepare some documents; I scribbled some remarks in my notebook, at the same time trying to ignore the ringing telephone and depended on Ms. Jarmila to pick it up.</p>
          <p>"She is a wonderful woman," I thought, because the telephone stopped ringing, but in a moment, I heard a signal from Ms. Jarmila. It must be something important because I know Ms. Jarmila well. She knows that I am just preparing for an important meeting, and would take a message to give to me later on.</p>
          <p>"I picked up the telephone, introduced myself after saying "Good morning" and recognized the voice of Karel Jicha from Brno's division of ICI Company.</p>
          <p>"Good morning, this is Karel Jicha, ICI. I have the official decision of our company. It has been decided to hire engineer Jozef Dobos from Brno. Bratislava's branch will not be opening."</p>

          <p>I opened my mouth to say something, but words were stuck in my throat. It seemed to me like a strike below one's belt, somehow my thoughts and mouth stopped collaborating. Finally, my mouth closed and somehow I yielded an answer: "But Mr. Jicha, when we talked about the position of technical sales representative for ICI Company last time, you felt strongly that I had a ninety-percent chance of getting it. Right now you are telling me that the position was given to someone who had a ten-percent chance.""</p>
            
          <p>"Mr. Bielek, I am telling you that this was the official decision," insisted Mr. Jicha.</p>
            
          <p>"What are the unofficial reasons for my non - acceptance?" I tried from another end.</p>
            
          <p>"I cannot say that indeed. I got a direct command not to say," kept on mister Jicha.</p>
            
          <p>The term "direct command" returned me from the world of dreams back into hard reality. "Direct command"; this can have only one source - Communist party involvement. I tried to change the tone of our conversation to a more personal, less official one. I laughed a little bit and said quietly: "Mr. Jicha, I fully understand that the ruling is definitive and nothing can be done to change it. Without consequence between us, tell me, what in fact happened. How is it possible that the ninety-percent chance I once had wasn't enough to win the contest?"</p>
          <p>"Well all right, Mr. Bielek," as he changed his tone.</p>

          <p>"Only between us and everywhere else I will deny that I have said anything like that. Our director was called from your regional Communist party committee and he was ordered to deny the position to Jan Bielek at the ICI Company. The Communist Party also forbade the opening of Bratislava's division," said Mr. Jicha and his voice was very weak, hardly audible on the telephone.</p>
            
          <p>"Thank you, thank you very much," I said very quietly and hung up the telephone.</p>
            
          <p>Ms. Jarmila opened the door to my office.</p>
            
          <p>"Mister Bielek, you have to go to a meeting with the vice-president…," she stopped in the middle of her sentence when she noticed I was still holding a dead telephone, with my eyes closed and with a helpless expression on my face. After a brief hesitation she said: "For God's sake, Mr. Bielek, somebody died?"</p>
            
          <p>"Just now I was informed from Brno that something died inside of me," I said, opened my eyes, took my note book and files and, as I passed by her, made a mental note of her uncomprehending face and sight. They were saying: "This young man has just gone crazy."</p>
            
          <p>With my head sagging, drowned in thoughts about the sheepishness of myself and the mighty strength of the Communists, I walked in the back yard towards the vice-president's office. I did not even notice that I was already there, just a few steps to the main company's entrance. Suddenly, I caught sight of two black shoes and black pants walking toward me. I lifted my head and Comrade Stromcek stood in front of me; the sight of him startled me into consciousness and, having been brought up by my mother always reminding me that I must respect older people, I let him go by waiting on the side until he passed.</p>
          <p>"Good morning," I greeted the comrade, as he walked by me without so much as an answer; only the nod of his head indicated that he acknowledged my presence. For a second, he threw another radioactive look at me. I let him pass by and at the same time thought that these types of people are most likely excluded from non-written laws that rule us, the common people. They could come in half an hour late and nobody had the authority to question them or demand reasons from them.</p>

          <p>"It has been unlikely that traveling by bus and the intimate proximity to others is what made them untouchable'," I thought. More likely, it was the Communist ID card, nicknamed the "red booklet." I come to work on time every day, but I was not "one of them" and at the same time I was perceived quite brash and "pampered" to be riding to work in my own car. I started to worry that the "justifying Communist's arm" will be falling on me very soon. As I entered the vice-president's office, not one of my colleagues lifted their eyes from their notes; only the vice-president pointedly lifted his left arm and looked at his watch through his glasses, then over his glasses at me: "So, we can finally start our meeting." His face was markedly red, despite the fact that fluorescent lighting drifted all colors into blue-green. I said in a weak voice: "Excuse me…I had a long distance call</p>
          <p>As usual, a meeting originally planned for an hour, took the whole morning. I could hardly pay any attention to what was happening during the meeting…More or less there was nothing to pay attention to. Department managers were not capable of leading their departments. They were managers because they were members of the Communist party. Among them, I was the only non-member sticking out like a sore thumb. The capability of a particular manager was judged according to how many problems he brought along to a meeting and how long he was able to talk about them. Problems were essentially not solved; they were just discussed at a meeting. Sometimes it seemed to me that problems were, in fact, a result of the existing political system and solving them could put Communism out of business. Frequently, I just looked around and wondered how it was possible that I ended up among them. Every now and then, I had a feeling that I had done something really bad in my life and now I was being punished for it. What was my big sin, I could never successfully find out. My memory was evidently slipping, or I had been delinquent in my early childhood because, no matter how hard I tried, I could not remember my sin. Thank God even party members needed to eat; otherwise meetings would never end. Noon approached slowly; otherwise, the endless string of yesterday's problems would never be finished. Today's problems will be endlessly chewed over again during a future meeting. Next time, there would be a very slight change. More or less the same thing was always spoken about over and over again. It seemed to me like the same song, but on each occasion played in another key. The difference was that the average song lasted for three and a half minutes; these meetings lasted three and a half hours</p>
          <p>I used to go to lunch to a corporate dining room that was outside of the company in a next-door building, about two hundred meters further down the street. The dining room was one of the "achievements" of Communism. The building in which the dining room was located was very poor and there was not a lot of imagination needed to name it "Miserable." It did not look any better from inside. The dining room was a long rectangular area with paint peeling off the ceiling. Some spots on the ceiling were covered with stains of various origins. Some of them were left by rainwater that seeped through the roof. Others were the result of non-existing ventilation. It was achieved by opening windows that could not open enough in summer or close enough in winter. In summer it would be unbearably hot inside, and what else but unbearably cold in the winter. Vapors from cooked food would find their convenient place on the ceiling and from there they would come down only when the original white paint peeled off and dropped down on our food. The aesthetics of the dining room were justified by red flags, signs like "With the Soviet Union For Ever" and pictures of Lenin, Marx, and Engels. These decorations were ideal because they could organize Communist party meetings there without any preparation. The tables and chairs were most likely the cheapest pieces of furniture that money could buy. Wooden tables were covered with Formica and uncomfortable wooden chairs made unpleasant screeching noises with the smallest movement on the floor. The floor was created by smooth ground concrete and polished cobblestones from concrete were the only decoration which the owner was willing to pay money for.</p>
